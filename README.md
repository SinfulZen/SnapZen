## SnapZen

### What Is SnapZen
SnapZen is an advanced mod for SnapChat, bringing extended functionality to the app. It's similar to SnapEnhance but safer to use, less detectable and has a ton more features!  


### Features
This section will be updated soon as there's alot of features to list!  


### Supported SnapChat Versions
All versions from 10.8.50.0 to the latest are supported.  


### Notes
For now, only the GUI / UI is being uploaded to this repo. If it gets enough attention, We may consider adding the full mod!  
- You may notice that the APK version is [1.0.0](https://github.com/SinfulZen/SnapZen) while the version in the app is different. As the APK is a WebView, there's no need for us to keep changing the APK version number!
