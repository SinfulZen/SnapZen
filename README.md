## SnapZen

### What Is SnapZen
SnapZen is an advanced mod for SnapChat, bringing extended functionality to the app. It's similar to SnapEnhance but safer to use, less detectable and has a ton more features!  


### Features
This section will be updated soon as there's alot of features to list!  


### Supported SnapChat Versions
All versions from 10.8.50.0 to the latest are supported. Please note that any version over 13.2.X.X will put Your account at risk (using certain features repeatedly). Yes SnapZen IS safe to use but SnapChat is now taking mods and third party installments very seriously. The most You would get is a temporary lock but to some People that can be annoying and worrying.  


### Notes
For now, only the GUI / UI is being uploaded to this repo. If it gets enough attention, We may consider adding the full mod!  
- You may notice that the APK version is [1.0.0](https://github.com/SinfulZen/SnapZen) while the version in the app is different. As the APK is a WebView, there's no need for us to keep changing the APK version number! As the actual mod is created in Kotlin & JS, the webview implementation is more of a tease / design test.
